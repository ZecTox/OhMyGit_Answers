# OhMyGit_Answers

This repo has my answers of Oh My Git Game - An open source game about learning Git!

If you also want to play the game then follow the [LINK](https://ohmygit.org/), download it and play it. <br> Also I find one website where you can refer to the answers [LINK](https://pierrejean.wp.imt.fr/2023/09/08/oh-my-git/).

>[!NOTE]
> The explanations of the problems in the game can sometimes be confusing, and at times, they don't provide enough clarity. Please stay calm and make an effort to solve them ;)
